from: htxps://ocdoc.cil.li/component:modem

the standard modem message signature is (modem_message) localAddress: string, remoteAddress: string, port: number, distance: number, .... 
a single message can be up to 8kib long, each element has 2 bytes of overhead, nil/number/boolean takes up 4b because lua is stupid, so string byte arrays are the superior mode of data transfer here.
the kittennet protocol messages rely on the last 2 variables being the packet type (string) and a message (string/byte array string)
any additional information will be discarded

so something that a signal pull might receive looks like [  modem_message, (receiver network card address) (remote network card address) 1234:port 4.65:distance c_exec:packet_type " say('some code here, default function') "  ]

the network callback parser receives the remote address, port, distance and the stringinfo in the last packet
provided by this code:    local ok, err = pcall(net_callbacks[packet_type], remote_addr, port, distance, stringinfo)
network callbacks should not return anything

use string.pack (format information at https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.4.2) for transfering anything thats not just text in the strininfo part of the packet
